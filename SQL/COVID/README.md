## COVID-19 Data Exploration 

### Background 
Over the past few years, COVID-19 has profoundly influenced all of us, and now there is data accessible to help us comprehend its varying effects on different countries.

Through data exploration, I examined a portion of the COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccination data to uncover trends/patterns using Google Big Query. 

### Process

The full dataset is from Our World In Data and can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). 

I used a subset of the data from Jan 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021 which I added to this respiratory. 

#### Data Preparation Process 

I, first, converted the XLSX files to CSV, so that the files can be uploaded to Big Query. After that, the data was queried. 

#### Analysis 

As this project focuses on data exploration, there were no particular questions requiring answers. The objective was to familiarize myself with the data, identify any discernible patterns or trends, if present, and compare statistics across different countries.

### Tableau Dashboard

I built a dashboard using the SQL quries code on Tableau. The dashboard can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/indu.sen1237/viz/COVIDDashboard_17030952249320/Dashboard1).
