## COVID-19 Data Exploration 

### Background 
Over the past few years, COVID-19 has profoundly influenced all of us, and now there is data accessible to help us comprehend its varying effects on different countries.

Through data exploration, I examined a portion of the COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccination data to uncover trends/patterns from using Google Big Query. 

### Data

The full dataset can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). 

I used a subset of the data from Jan 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021 which I added to this respiratory.
